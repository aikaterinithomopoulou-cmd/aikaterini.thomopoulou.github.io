Hi! I' Aikaterini
I am in the fourth year of my doctoral studies at the Department of Translation and Language Sciences at Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), under the supervision of Josep Quer. 
My doctoral research focuses on the syntax of Greek pseudocoordination and the behavior of the connective ke 'and' in these structures. 
I hold an MA in Linguistics from the University of Patras, where I studied ke as a subordinating conjunction under the supervision of Anna Roussou, as well as a BA in Greek Philology with a specialization 
in Linguistics from the same university. In 2025, I completed a three-month research stay as a visiting PhD student at ZAS, where I collaborated with Artemis Alexiadou. 
My research interests include theoretical syntax, the lexicon-syntax interface, the syntax-semantics interface, and, in particular, coordination, pseudocoordination, and complementation in Greek.
